This project was made for Printemps, a French department store, according to a design by [UUfie](http://www.uufie.com/all/printemps-haussmann-verticalite/). The manufacturer was [Sipral, a.s.](http://www.sipral.cz/en/home), the Czech company which created the proposal and can manage production facades of buildings from steel or aluminium materials.

The superstructure represents a facade of the Parisian department store Printemps Haussmann Verticalit√©.
