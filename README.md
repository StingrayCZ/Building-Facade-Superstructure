# Building Facade Superstructure

This project was made for Printemps, a French department store, according to a design by [UUfie](http://www.uufie.com/all/printemps-haussmann-verticalite/) - Canadian . The manufacturer was [Sipral, a.s.](http://www.sipral.cz/en/home), the Czech company which created the proposal and can manage production facades of buildings from steel or aluminium materials. The superstructure represents a facade of the Parisian department store Printemps Haussmann Verticalit√©.

My role in this project involved creating a precise CAD model based on 2D documentation from the author of the origin design - UUfie. Authors documentation in DWG. format just contained a sketch of petal-shaped holes. Firt of all I imported this document to SolidWorks, after that I make front surface into which I created holes based on 2D sketch. The next step was split the surface to eleven segments. For every segment I add solid

The main problem were two ending segments. Solidworks is not designed for making flat-pattern from flanged sheet with coplicated shape of holes. But explode shape is The solution required wit and considerable effort.
